# Lagrangian-modeling
#Python code needed to conduct Lagrangian stochastic modeling (both forward and backward) of turbulent diffusion. 
#Both the traditional and a new concentration estimators are used to calculate C/Q ratio with the backward implementation.
#To run the program, run python with MainParallel.py
#Test case data are in Microsoft Word file "test data for concentration estimator.docx"
